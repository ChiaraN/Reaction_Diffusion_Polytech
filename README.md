# Reaction_Diffusion_Polytech
A school group project concerning reaction diffusion systems and creation of patterns. The work is done by Paola Allegrini, Claire Froessel and Mahshid Khezri Nejad.

This repository consists of matlab codes that are to study reaction-only systems, systems with diffusion and Gierer-Meinhardt model which is a reaction-diffusion system.

There are two directories: Reaction , Diffusion.
In 'Reaction' reaction-only systems are studied and 'Diffusion' diffusion only systems are studied.
